In planning the robbery, Dennes and his brother had set up an office in the same building as the victim in order to learn its layout and the location of surveillance cameras. They employed a maid to leave a back door open to the building on the day of the robbery. The victim was shot to death as he sat at his desk inside his office in downtown Houston. His office safe was emptied of $4.25 million in loose diamonds and gems along with more than $250,000 in cash. After killing the victim and cleaning out the safe, Dennes disguised himself with a baseball cap and fake mustache and went to the first floor with the intention of removing the surveillance videotape that had recorded he and his brother's entry to the building. There he was confronted by an unarmed security guard who was shot twice and left for dead. Dennes took the tape from the surveillance camera and fled. Dennes was arrested after a gunsmith who fashioned a silencer for the 9mm pistol Dennes used in the robbery went to police. The wounded security guard recovered to identify Dennes as the gunman as well."

Wesbrook believed this meeting was for a possible marital reconciliation, but when he arrived, there were others present. He sat around drinking with all of them. At some point in the evening, Wesbrook noticed that his ex-wife and two of the men had slipped away, and when he went into the bedroom, he found her having sex with both of the men. Wesbrook then went to his truck and pulled out his .36-caliber hunting rifle and returned to the residence. He then fatally shot his ex-wife and all three of the males in the residence. Another female was injured, but survived the shooting."

Two people (who were brothers) were killed and 6 were injured by gunfire. On 06/17/98 Alvarez shot and killed 2 young males with shotguns in an apartment complex in Southwest Houston. The victims were shot at close range in the back and face. In this shooting, Alvarez supplied the shotgun and the same SKS assault rifle. Alvarez was identified at trial as the shooter. Officers found the shotgun and the SKS assault rifle in his closet. Testimony showed that none of the 4 victims in these incidents were members of the rival gang. Evidence presented at the punishment faze of the trial showed that Alvarez shot and killed a hispanic in an apparent random attack on 05/30/98 as the victim was driving home on IH-45 in Houston, Texas."
